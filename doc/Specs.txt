Target
======
The intent of the project is development of software for remote-monitoring of any kind of devices connected to the internet.

Preface
====
In many situations it is important to get information from or configurate a device located in a distanced place.
Think about e.g. webservers sending e-mail alerts on failures and providing remote accessed to the authorised persons.
While in web-technology related domains this scenarios are obvious, there are still many industries not usig the internet as the communication channel
or using it only for high-price products. The later are e.g. home-automation system or high-end cars.

Imagine, you distribute machines, which require maintanance. E.g. you run public photo automats in some shopping centers.
As you pay for the area, where they are installed, you may be interested in maximized return of investment. 
You may send an employee once a day to check the stock of photo-paper, to get coins, to refill change-coins, to observe damages and so on.
Or you can extend the photo automat with additional hardware able to provide this information via the internet.
One way for doing this, would be implementing an "embedded web-server" in the device and accessing the sensors (e.g paper-empty sensor) via GCI.
This approach was popular some time around 2000 and produced "embedded web-server" hype in the industry. However, for security reasons, 
dynamic IP-Address accessibility, proxy/firewall/port-forwarding configuration issues, and the internet-costs such solutions worked only at exibitions.

The Idea
========
Nowadays, low prices for webhosting, mobile 3G connections and excellent web-development frameworks allow another approach. A webserver in the internet should act as data-storage and 
central access point for the maintanance personell. The devices could send (upload) their status information as well as other data via http(s) protocol.
This way, the devices may be located behind proxy servers or firewalls. Monitoring them requires no incoming connection. 
Thus, minimizing security-threats and configuration-effort. 
This is the approach taken by Reatha project.
The idea is not new. Many applications work same way, e.g. TeamViewer, WhatsApp, splunk, etc.
The only problem with that is, the possibly sensitive data is stored (at least temporarily) on a third party server. The major internet-players 
make a big deal promoting cloud-storaging. Though they are pretty successfull in selling the loose control on your data as the state of the art in IT, some
companies may be not comfortable with this.
Reatha should address both deployment scenarious, depending on the sensivity of the data. The server part could be installed on users's webserver, so the user had complete controll over the data, 
monitored devices as well as persons having access to the devices.
Another scenario is, the user may relay on already installed infrastructure, e.g. reatha.de, registers her devices there.

The reatha-project consists of 3 main parts:
1. Software (and hrdware) used by devices for uploading data. In most cases the device will use a library implementing secure connection, data upload, 
instructions retrieval.
2. Server-side software implementing user-, device-, domain-management and data-storage
3. User-interface, which may be implemented either on the server (website, html, js) or in the client side (app, application collecting data from web-server)

Applications Scenarios
======================
A1. A single user wants to monitor and control her home during the hollidays
 Home automation system provides information on temperature, heating system, alarm-system, etc.
-Market refrigirator sends temperature data, which is recorded on the webserver. 
-Labor automates providing current process step and alarming on errors/finish-states
-Food automates provide error/empty states.
