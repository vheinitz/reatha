# Pull requests not currently accepted

Very sorry, but I can't currently accept pull requests into this specific plugin due to licensing terms. This limitation *only* applies to Knockout-Projections - it *does not* apply to [Knockout.js itself](http://knockoutjs.com/), which does accept pull requests :)

If you have a feature suggestion, then either:

  * [Post it as an issue](https://github.com/SteveSanderson/knockout-projections/issues/). Please don't provide a suggested implementation, but instead just describe the requirements in words so that I can implement it if agreed.

  * Or, fork this repo and implement your feature in a separate fork. The beauty of distributed source control is that you're not dependent on a central repo to share and collaborate on enhancements!
