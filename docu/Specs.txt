Target
======
The intent of the project is development of software for remote-monitoring of any kind of devices connected to the internet.

Preface
====
In many situations it is important to get information from or configurate a device located in a distanced place.
Think about e.g. webservers sending e-mail alerts on failures and providing remote accessed to the authorised persons.
While in web-technology related domains this scenarios are obvious, there are still many industries not usig the internet as the communication channel
or using it only for high-price products. The later are e.g. home-automation system or high-end cars.

Imagine, you distribute machines, which require maintanance. E.g. you run public photo automats in some shopping centers.
As you pay for the area, where they are installed, you may be interested in maximized return of investment. 
You may send an employee once a day to check the stock of photo-paper, to get coins, to refill change-coins, to observe damages and so on.
Or you can extend the photo automat with additional hardware able to provide this information via the internet.
One way for doing this, would be implementing an "embedded web-server" in the device and accessing the sensors (e.g paper-empty sensor) via GCI.
This approach was popular some time around 2000 and produced "embedded web-server" hype in the industry. However, for security reasons, 
dynamic IP-Address accessibility, proxy/firewall/port-forwarding configuration issues, and the internet-costs such solutions worked only at exibitions.

The Idea
========
Nowadays, low prices for webhosting, mobile 3G connections and excellent web-development frameworks allow another approach. A webserver in the internet should act as data-storage and 
central access point for the maintanance personell. The devices could send (upload) their status information as well as other data via http(s) protocol.
This way, the devices may be located behind proxy servers or firewalls. Monitoring them requires no incoming connection. 
Thus, minimizing security-threats and configuration-effort. 
This is the approach taken by Reatha project.
The idea is not new. Many applications work same way, e.g. TeamViewer, WhatsApp, splunk, etc.
The only problem with that is, the possibly sensitive data is stored (at least temporarily) on a third party server. The major internet-players 
make a big deal promoting cloud-storaging. Though they are pretty successfull in selling the loose control on your data as the state of the art in IT, some
companies may be not comfortable with this.
Reatha should address both deployment scenarious, depending on the sensivity of the data. The server part could be installed on users's webserver, so the user had complete controll over the data, 
monitored devices as well as persons having access to the devices.
Another scenario is, the user may relay on already installed infrastructure, e.g. reatha.de, registers her devices there.

The reatha-project consists of 3 main parts:
1. Software (and hrdware) used by devices for uploading data. In most cases the device will use a library implementing secure connection, data upload, 
instructions retrieval.
2. Server-side software implementing user-, device-, domain-management and data-storage
3. User-interface, which may be implemented either on the server (website, html, js) or in the client side (app, application collecting data from web-server)

Applications Scenarios
======================
A1. A single user wants to monitor and control her home during the hollidays
 Home automation system provides information on temperature, heating system, alarm-system, etc.
-Market refrigirator sends temperature data, which is recorded on the webserver. 
-Labor automates providing current process step and alarming on errors/finish-states
-Food automates provide error/empty states.

3.2.1 Assign users to domain
3.2.2 Remove users from domain
3.2.3 Assign devices to domain
3.2.4 Remove devices from domain

Data-Pool
=========
Main part of the system is the data-pool - a list of process-variables which are updated by the device and monitored by the client.
Each device has one data-pool vontaining many data-items
Each data-item consists of
 1) ID - unique name (within device context) identifying the item. Allowed format: [a-zA-Z][0-9a-zA-Z_.]*
 2) Timestamp - unix time stmap of the last change in local time of the server.
 3) Value - string duck-type value
NOTE! In future the structure may be changed.  
      E.g. for performance reasons stronger typing may be specified allowing to store values of different types in separate tables,
	  value-constraints, update-time constraints could be added etc. 
	  However, for the pilot-phase this simple structure it's OK.

I'd suggest the implementation structure in DB as following:
Table DeviceData
	DeviceID, DataItemID, Timestamp, Value
	
Communication protocol
======================
The device updates its data-pool by pushing its values (get or post).
The request should contain
 1) Device's UID
 2) One or more key-value pairs <ID>=<Value>
Example: http://reatha.de/rm/update.php?UID=4711E3F8J6VFJ35F9GJU&status=ok&temperature=6&door=closed

Testing with Test Client
------------------------
In current test-client implementation only one key-value pair can be sent. The placeholders in URL %1,%2,%3
correspond to UID, key,value respectively. e.g:http://reatha.de/rm/update.php?UID=%1&%2=%3
Script section contains instruction (one per line) for updating value automatically. The format is:
<variable>;<update time in ms>;<1st value>;<2nd value>[;<3rd value>]
E.G:
temperature;1000;10;20;30;40;30;20
This line would update temperature variable each second increasing from 10 to 40 and back to 10
At least two values are required.

Notification
=============
Notification is the main feature and intent of reatha. Whenever a device runs in a critical situation, the corresponding user should be informed.
 -Every user should be able to set-up the notification triggers and the messages to be sent for her.
 -The notification definition is valid within user-device combination context. That means: 
   -Different users may get different notifications from same device.
   -One user may get notification and another not at all.
 -The user should be able to define different notifications for similar devices.
 -The user should be able to define as many notification items from as many devices as she likes.
 -Every notification item consists of:
  -Variable triggering the notification
  -Condition
  -Minimal Interval
  -Timestamp of last send notification
  -Message template
  WHERE
   -Variable is the name of  a device's variable(, the user is allowed to watch)
   -Condition is a expression-string containing variable names and operators.
    -For the first step, the condition should be a string for regular expression to check against the value of triggering variable
	 The check is applied on value-update (e.g. using PHP's preg_match )
	 Later, (AFTER FEATURE COMPLETE MILESTONE) the condition should contain any variables and operators. e.g. "{temp}>100 && {pressure}>10}"
	 Before such expression is evaluated (e.g. by https://github.com/rezzza/exprlib or other lib similar to JS eval)
	 the variables-placeholders in {} are replaced by actual variable values
   -Minimal Interval (in seconds) is the time-interval which should pass since last sent notification. 
    Otherwise, the device may cause a mass of e-mails sent to user. There is no use to send notifications faster then the user can react.
   -Timestamp of last send notification is used to check on incomming values (triggers), wether interval passed and either send notification or ignore variable update
    The user can reset all Timestamps in device view (set timestamp to 0)
   -Message template: String containing placeholders for variables. E.g.: "Temperature to high: {temp}" where {temp} should be replaced by the actual value of the variable "temp"
    Feel free to chose another reserved characters to mark placeholders.
	It would be nice, if the message template could contain any mark-up syntax like "\n" or "<br>", whatever is feasible.

Examples
--------

temperature, /[1-9][0-9]{2}/, 3600, "Temperature too high: {temperature}"
	Message: "Temperature too high: <Temp>" is sent every hour, whenever temperature is >=100

status, /[eE]rror/, 30000000, "Error occured"
    Message: "Error occured" sent nearly every year (practically once)
	
UI for notification definition
------------------------------
The notifications should be defned in a separate device-notification config view.
This UI should be accessible by user from menu or an icon-link in context of device-view.
In the same manner as admin adds and deletes devices or users, the user should be able to add and delete notification items.
