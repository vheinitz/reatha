Reatha 
======

Reatha is a web platform prototype for remote device monitoring. It uses the web as a medium between the user and the monitored device. 
This project was used as a prototype. We are not working on it any more. The reason is mostly the use of PHP, which is
not suitable for some important planned features. However, the prototype has ben used very successfully for acquisition and on excibition-demonstrations. If you are looking for a device-monitoring solution which is production-ready, consider checking this links: http://reatha.de/links.html
